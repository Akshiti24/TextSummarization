# **Text Summarization Project**

This project uses a self made neural network made using `Tensorflow-Keras` framework

## **Installation**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd <project_directory>
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies using `pip` and the provided `requirements.txt` file:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## **Run The Project**

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the Streamlit application by executing the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
